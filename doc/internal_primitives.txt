* After parsing, classes consists of the following primitives:

[array Type Name Size InitValue]
[unknown Varname]
[int Varname]
[float Varname]
[Classtype Object-name]
[method Name Args | Code]

(Constructor code is placed in two autogenerated methods called ___init and ___initrepeat)


* After parsing, methods consist of a language built up of
the following primitives;

  [int        Name |_]
  [float      Name |_]
  [if _       | Code ]
  [begin      | Code ]
  [set!            |_]
  [multi-set!      |_]
  [array-set!      |_]
  [function-name-hint|_]
  [object-get Name |_]
  [object-call-get Name |_]
  [object-call     |_]
  [object-set!     |_]
  [return          |_]
